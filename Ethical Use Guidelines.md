# Ethical Use Guidelines for Art Contest

## Introduction
Welcome to Art Contest. This document outlines the ethical use guidelines for our AI-art generation and evaluation project. Our goal is to explore the potential of AI in the field of art while maintaining ethical standards.

## Ethical Principles
1. **Transparency:** All art produced by our AI is clearly labeled as AI-generated to maintain honesty and clarity in its origin.
2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination:** Our AI strives to avoid biases and does not discriminate on any basis, including race, gender, or cultural background.
3. **Respect for Artistic Integrity:** While the AI creates art, users should respect the integrity of human artists and not misrepresent AI-generated art as human-created.

## Usage Guidelines
1. **Content Creation:** The AI-generated art should not be used to produce illegal, offensive, or harmful content. Users are responsible for the content they generate using our AI.
2. **Intellectual Property:** Users should be aware of and respect intellectual property rights when using AI-generated art, especially for commercial purposes.
3. **Data Privacy:** Although our project does not collect personal data, users should still be mindful of privacy considerations in their interactions.
