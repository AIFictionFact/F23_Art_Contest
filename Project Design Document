Art Project
Toba Akinyemi: akinyo2

Project Overview
Goals:
- Explore the potential of AI in the field of art
- Evaluate the quality of AI-generated art through the use of a separate judging AI system trained on the winning results from art competitions
- By utilizing the capabilities of both the art-generation and the judging AIs, we hope to identify the AI-generated art pieces that best align with human aesthetic preferences.
- In doing so, we aspire to develop an AI that produces art that best encapsulates human subjectivity, aiming for an "optimal" artistic outcome.

Related AI Projects
- Not much research done in the realm of using AI to judge art
  - YOLO has been tested on paintings
    - Able to perform classification and detection (though not very impressive)
- Art generation on the other hand has been worked on extensively
  - DALL-E
  - Bing
  - Midjourney
  - etc.

Functional Requirements:
- Generate 10 pieces of art in an art style specified by the user
- Train a neural network to find patterns across the winning results from art competitions
- Rank generated art pieces by likelihood of winning an art contest

Non-Functional Requirements:
- The art-generation AI should be able to generate the 10 art pieces less than 60 seconds
- The judging AI’s preferences should be consistent and produce the same results across repeated trials
- The user interface should be accessible to both technical and non-technical users

Technologies to Be Used
- Programming Language: Python 3, NumPy, OpenCV/PyTorch
- DALL-E 3: Image generation - OpenAI API

User Profiles
- Professional and Amateur Artists: evaluate their own art pieces
- Art Educators: teach students about techniques for quality art in a more visual and interactive manner
- Art Museums:  explore opportunities for exhibiting AI-generated art
- Art Judges: define more objective criteria for AI art competitions
- Psychologists: learn more about the nature of human subjectivity

Technical Limitations
Generation
- Human figures (hands, teeth, etc.)
- Input quality (bad prompt = bad image)
- Accuracy of image to prompt
Evaluation
- Can’t properly “rank” the images
- Classification does not have a limit of one image per label
- As such, limited to giving each image a general ranking instead of a comparative one

User Interface (UI)/User Experience (UX)
1. Begin with a “Generate Art” button
2. User selects art-style from a drop-down menu
3. Loading bar while AI is generating art pieces
4. After generation is complete, art pieces are displayed in grid format
5. User can press “Judge Art” button
6. There may be multiple art pieces for each placing
- Accessible to non-technical and inartistic users

Team Roles and Responsibility
Toba and Josh
- Development and training of model
- Creation of presentations/reports

- Generation of AI art
- Testing of network with generated art
